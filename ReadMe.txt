THE GAME
THE STORY
Akara Sobra is a young warrior who comes from an ancient family called the "Valians". His homeland has been took over
by the demonic king Malekura, who raised barriers to prevent anyone from going beyond the land of Vrakanos. After nearly
two-hundred years, this young man sets off on a journey after being urged by the townspeople, to go forth and vanquish
the hell-born king!

GAMEPLAY
In the beginning of the game you will be prompted to either "Continue", or to start a "New Game". If you haven't saved yet
or if you want to start a new adventure, then select "New Game". At the beginning, you will be prompted to select your race,
class, name, gender, skills, traits, and more! Afterwards, the player will be explained the story, and will be asked to collect three
artifacts which will allow the player to face Malekura. To collect them, the player must battle against three of Malekura's cohorts
who are scattered across the map. For the rest of the game you will navigate a 20 X 11 map full of enemies, stores, and villages. As 
you play you can gain followers, items, and exp. When you level up, you gain a certain amount of "skill points" which can raise any one 
of your stats. To use them, simply select "Use Skillpoints" from the menu. You also gain access to new and powerful "special" attacks as you
level up. Each class has their own variety of specials. If at any time you wish to save your game, select it from the menu.



STRATEGIES
SURVIVING
"New Age" is meant to be extremely difficult. Surviving is a major challenge, and death can be humiliating (and debilitating because you have
to START ALL OVER AGAIN). From levels 1-3, you want to stay inside of plains and hills. From levels 3-6, you can venture to the forests. Later
from levels 6-9, the swamps, tundras, and deserts are much easier to traverse. Then, from levels 9-12, the jungle, mountains, and graveyard should be safe
to go to. Finally, from levels 12 and beyond, the volcanoes and caves become far more welcoming. Remember to save up gold to buy weapons, pets, and armor early
on in the game. They provide a huge boost to your stats, making it easier to survive.



TIPS+HINTS
RUNNING AWAY
The chances of successfully running away from an enemy are slim. The formula below is used to calculate run away success:

(Random Number From 1-20) + (Player's Speed) + (Speed Bonuses) - (Enemy's Speed) - (Enemy's Speed Bonuses)

If the number produced by this equation is equal to or greater than 20 than you have successfully ran away! Don't attempt running away however unless
you have high speed, otherwise you probably won't be able to escape.

EQUIPPING ITEMS
After buying or obtaining a sword, wand, or some armor you need to equip it before it starts giving you any bonuses! You can do this by selecting the
option "Equip Item" from the menu. Keep in mind, you can only have up to one wand, one sword, and one armor equipped at any given time.

DEALING MORE DAMAGE AND FINDING MORE ITEMS
Whenever you deal a high amount of combat damage, grab a new item laying on the ground, or get a critical hit you want to start moving or attacking quickly! This will
raise the chances of you getting the same result in succession. In another light, this means that when an enemy is dealing lots of damage, or you aren't dealing the enemy that
much damage, then you should wait and pause for several moments before attempting to attack again.
